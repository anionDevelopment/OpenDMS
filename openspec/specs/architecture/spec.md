# Architecture Specification

## Purpose

Records the architectural constraints which every change to this product has to respect. They are not derivable from the
source-code itself: they state where logic is allowed to live, what decides whether the product is in a healthy state, and
how the codeunits of this repository may depend on each other.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Domain-logic lives only in the business-logic-service

Domain-logic SHALL exist only in the business-logic-service (`OpenDMSBackend/OpenDMSBackend/Services/BusinessLogicService.cs`). Controllers, middlewares,
persistence-implementations, views and background-services SHALL delegate to it instead of deciding anything about the
domain themselves.

#### Scenario: A controller needs a decision about the domain

- **WHEN** a controller needs a decision which depends on the domain - a permission, a state-transition, a calculation, a
  validation-rule
- **THEN** that decision is implemented in the business-logic-service, and the controller only calls it and maps its result
  to a response

#### Scenario: A persistence-implementation needs a decision about the domain

- **WHEN** a persistence-implementation would have to decide something about the domain
- **THEN** the decision is moved to the business-logic-service, because there is more than one persistence-implementation
  and a decision which lives in one of them makes the product behave differently depending on which one is used

### Requirement: "scbuildcodeunits" is the single source of truth for the state of the pipeline

The command `scbuildcodeunits` SHALL always be executable in this repository, and it SHALL succeed whenever the repository
is in a healthy state. Whether the pipeline of this product is green SHALL be decided by that command and by nothing else.

#### Scenario: A change is considered finished

- **WHEN** a change is considered finished
- **THEN** `scbuildcodeunits` has been executed on it and has succeeded

#### Scenario: Another tool reports a different result

- **WHEN** an IDE, a single manually executed step or any other tool reports a result which differs from the result of
  `scbuildcodeunits`
- **THEN** the result of `scbuildcodeunits` is the one which counts, and the deviation is treated as a defect of the other
  tool or of its configuration

### Requirement: A codeunit only accesses codeunits which it declares as its dependencies

A codeunit SHALL NOT access the source-code of another codeunit unless that other codeunit is declared as a dependent
codeunit in its `<codeunit-name>.codeunit.xml`. The codeunits of this repository are: OpenDMS, OpenDMSBackend, OpenDMSFrontend.

#### Scenario: A codeunit needs functionality of another codeunit

- **WHEN** a codeunit needs functionality which another codeunit of this repository provides
- **THEN** that other codeunit is declared under `dependentcodeunits` in the codeunit-file, and its functionality is used
  through its build-result instead of through its source-code

#### Scenario: An undeclared access exists

- **WHEN** a codeunit reads, includes, compiles or references source-code of a codeunit which is not declared as its
  dependency
- **THEN** this is a defect, which is resolved either by declaring the dependency or by removing the access
